# Sentence Segmentation of Scientific Papers into RDF Triples

This project aims to segment scientific papers into sentences and convert the sentences into RDF triples for use in knowledge graphs and semantic web applications.

## Abstract

Scientific papers contain a vast amount of knowledge that can be leveraged for various applications such as knowledge graphs and semantic web applications. However, the unstructured nature of scientific papers makes it difficult to extract useful information from them. In this project, we propose a method for sentence segmentation of scientific papers into RDF triples. The proposed method involves using natural language processing techniques to segment the text into sentences and convert them into RDF triples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Description

The repository contains the code for the following tasks:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Sentence segmentation
* RDF triple extraction

The data used for this project consists of scientific papers in PDF format. The PDFs are converted to text format and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.

The sentences are then segmented using natural language processing techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. The segmented sentences are then converted into RDF triples using a set of rules and templates.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for sentence segmentation of scientific papers into RDF triples. The results show that the method can be used to extract useful information from unstructured scientific papers for use in knowledge graphs and semantic web applications.
